# MyReads Project

This is react application, which is part of Udacity's front end web developer nanodegree. The project's template was copied from [here][1]. The project uses [Create React App][2] to bootstrap the application.

## Running Locally

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
